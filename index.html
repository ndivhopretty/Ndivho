   <h1><i><u><b>About Myself</i></u></b></h1>
  <h1><p><b><i><b>I am Ndivho,a 16 years old girl from Rathidili near Madombidzha.I attend school at Jonathan Secondary school in
       grade 11.I'm cool,kind and little talkative.I just hate being annoyed and
        yelled at because i end up being bad at you.You should pay same attention
        as mine and be good at each other.You must know that when i'm around
        you,you have to be patient with me.I really care mostly about myself and
         when it comes to other people also.When there's something thats bothering
        me inside i dont share it with anyone because i have anger issues so i
         kept quite as if nothing is happening.I smile with/at everyone for them
         to feel good around people and also make jokes for them.When i'm at
           home i like spending time alone or with my parents i be not wanting
          any visitor.Yes,thats me for you im not bad as you think it's just that
           people cannot describe me the way i am.</b></i></b></p></h1>
